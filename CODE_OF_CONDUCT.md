# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
* Using welcoming and inclusive language.
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
* Focusing on what is best for the community.
* Showing empathy towards other team members.

## Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (GitHub, Discord, WhatsApp), and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.
